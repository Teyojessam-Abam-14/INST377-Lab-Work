<p>CSS selectors let you <em>select</em> individual HTML elements in an HTML document. This is <strong>super</strong> useful.</p>
<p>Classes are ridiculously important, since they allow you to select arbitrary boxes in your web pages.</p>
<p>Once you successfully develop a set of selectors and CSS rules, it's relatively easy to match a 
   document with those <br>
   rules
