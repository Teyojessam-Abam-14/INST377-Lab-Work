<h3>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h3>

<p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Empty Elements</p>

<p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>
<p>Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>

Images 

Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
